# DataBrew-Data-Analysis-Dashbaord
Ever wondered how data can tell a story, just like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee awakens your senses?
Read to discover the inspiration behind DataBrew. 

DataBrew is more than just a project; it's a journey of transforming raw data into rich, flavorful insights. Just as a barista carefully selects and blends coffee beans, we meticulously curated and analyzed data using MySQL and Tableau to extract meaningful stories hidden within. 

Our Approach 

We took a two-step approach to 'brewing' these insights:" 

Section 1: MySQL - The Foundation 

Building the perfect blend starts with the right ingredients.  

Using MySQL, I performed the initial steps in Data Analysis, such as cleaning and transforming the raw data, addressing inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. I also designed a relational database schema optimized for analysis and wrote complex queries to extract necessary information. 

 

Section 2: Tableau - The Art of Visualization 

Presentation is key.  

With Tableau, I crafted interactive dashboards that bring the data to life. From insightful charts and graphs to intuitive maps, we transformed complex data into compelling visuals that reveal hidden patterns and trends 

Key Insights  

The result? A rich brew of insights that can drive informed decision-making.
